 General Information about the Module
 ====================================

 This is the file for architectural information (if there is any
 that is worth to be called so) of the IPtables Firewall Module.



 Overall Structure
 -----------------
 
 The module has three operation modes: Newbie, Template and Expert Mode.

 The Newbie mode let's the user choose between a disabled firewall, three
 different security modes and full security. Full means that NO traffic
 will go through the firewall! Really NO traffic!
 The three security modes between are low, medium and high. Where low
 accepts the most common services for a network and some additional
 network administration tools.
 The medium level allows only services known to be as harmless as
 possible (HTTP, NNTP, SMTP).
 The high mode only accepts the most important services like Web and
 mail.
 
 The template modes allows the user to enable specific network
 protocols for traffic. The user can choose from interface combinations
 shown on the top of the screen as tabs. For example inside->dmz or
 inside->internet.
 The templates are some that I wrote templates for or self-defined
 templates that can be defined with the "Define Template" link at
 the bottom of the page.
 
 The expert modes is for the really advanced users. It allows the "raw"
 edit of chains and rules with all supported parameters. You should use
 this mode for special constructs.



 Differences to the IPchains Module
 ----------------------------------
 
 Importing of old settings is not supported.


 Internationalisation (i18n)
 ---------------------------
 
 Internationalisation support is pretty simple. The lang subdirectory
 has a file called "en". Copy it an translate all lines as described
 in the Webmin Module Writers Help (to be found at
 http://www.niemueller.de/webmin/writers-help/) and rename the file
 to the ISO shortcut (like "de" for German).
 The Descriptions for the templates are in the subdirectory called
 "descriptions/LANGUAGE", where LANGUAGE is the short cut (like en
 or de).
 The graphics for the levels contain also text so they are prepared
 for i18n. The module looks for images with the name
 IMAGE.LANGUAGE.gif in the images subdirectory, where IMAGE is the
 name of the level (disabled, low, medium, high, full, always in
 english!) and LANGUAGE the language abbreviation (like en or de).
 Use IMAGE.gif as a template.
