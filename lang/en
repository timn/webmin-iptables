config_link=Check <A HREF=/config.cgi?iptables>Module Configuration</A>

index_title=IPtables Firewall

index_cfnotdef=Configuration file not defined
index_desc_cfdef=The configuration file is not yet defined. That is the file where this module will store the information about your firewall. A good idea is /etc/iptfw.conf.
index_conffile=Path to config file
index_devnotdef=Network Devices not yet defined
index_fwfile=Firewall script has not been copied
index_desc_devdef=You have not yet defined what kind of interface each device is. You now need to define what the interface should be supposed to do. You have to define at least one internal interface and at least one external oder Internet interface. Below you see what the types mean.
index_desc_internal=<B>Internal</B> Interface is an interface that connects to your (whole or part of) LAN.
index_desc_external=An <B>external</B> interface connects to a specified (fixed, not changing IPs) network that is assumed to have an unknown security grade (it may be your best friend but it may also be your worst enemy)
index_desc_dmz=<B>DMZ</B>, <I>D</I>e<I>m</I>ilitarized <I>Z</I>one. That is a part of your network that is in front of the firewall and so not secured by it. Usually Webservers etc. are put there to minimize the incoming traffic to the LAN. You can choose special guidelines for the traffic from this network. For example if you may want to allow it the local clients to use it as their mailserver.
index_desc_internet=<B>Internet</B>, a network that has a fixed or dynamic IP. It is always assumed to be as hostile as "Big Brother Bill" himself.
index_desc_vpn=<B>Virtual Private Network</B>: An encrypted network tunnel to another network. This is basically a specially routed external Network. It will be handled like an external network.
index_desc_ignore=<B>Ignore</B>: Do not care about it in the firewall configuration. The network traffic on this interface is not secured. This may be a really big hole in your firewall depending on the connections on this interface. You should only put the needed interfaces into a firewall box!
index_desc_fwfile=The "translator" script firewall.pl has not yet been copied to your bootdir. This is needed to execute the firewall rules stored in the configuration file.
index_copyfwfile=Copy the script
index_internal=Internal
index_external=External
index_dmz=DMZ
index_internet=Internet
index_vpn=Virtual Private Network
index_ignore=Ignore
index_ifnotdef=Network Interfaces not detected
index_desc_ifdef=Cannot use the Network Configuration module to detect your network devices. It seems that your Linux distribution is not supported by the module or the module is not installed. Please enter below a comma (,) separated list of network interfaces (for example "eth0,eth1,ippp0").

lib_err_nosupport=Either the /proc filesystem does not exist or iptables is not supported by your kernel. Maybe you have to load the ip_tables module (insmod ip_tables)? Or do you have an 2.2.x or earlier kernel version?
lib_err_sfcm=You have not entered a script file. It is needed because all rules will be written with the appropriate directives into this script file. $1
lib_err_sfmiss=The script file $1 you entered in the <A HREF=../config.cgi?iptables>module configuration</A> does not exist. After you created it come back and all works properly. This is a normal configuration step and not an real error, but one step ahead to a working IPchains Module installation!
lib_noinit=Could not find your init directory. You have to set it manually. $1.
lib_needmodernperl=This module needs a newer version of Perl (at least $1). Please upgrade your Perl and try again.
lib_err_netmod=Cannot detect network interfaces. Please set in the $1
lib_parseerror=Syntax error in the config file in line $1

clev_desc_high=This will change your security level to <FONT COLOR=#00FF00>high</FONT>.
clev_desc_disabled=This will <FONT COLOR=#FF0000>disable</FONT> your firewall. You will no longer be secured. Any passing packets will be accepted. If forwarding is enabled all packets get forwared without filtering.
clev_desc_full=Your system will <FONT COLOR=#00FF00>batten down the hatches</FONT>. All traffic coming to your system or trying to pass your system will be unanswered dropped. Maybe useful if there is a known security problem on the net and you want to protect your systems.
clev_prot=Protocol
clev_dirs=Allowed Directions
clev_nocons=No connections are allowed in this security level (Loopback traffic will work anyway).
clev_disabled_masq=Masquerading support is not available in DISABLED level

clev_full_masq=Masquerading support is not available in FULL security level
clev_enable=Enable firewall configuration immediately. Please don't use it when using the module for the first time on a remote system since you may be locked out when problems occur!
clev_change=Yes, change security level
clev_return=level selection
clev_err_write=Failed to create script file!
