SNMP is all all what the name says, but not simple ;-)
To explain the templates I take inside -> firewall as an example:
The inside -> firewall template allows management stations on the
internal networks to access a SNMP server on the firewall and traps
can go out from the firewall to management stations on the internal
network.
