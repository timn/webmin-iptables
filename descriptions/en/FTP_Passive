FTP is the File Transfer Protocol. It is used to transfer files, its most
common use is to upload files to your website.
Passive FTP does not send a PORT command but it rather just opens
a connection pretty simple. The problem now is that you have to allow
basically nearly any traffic to be able to use it. It is recommended
to not use passive FTP or FTP at all.
