HTTP is the HyperText Transport Protocol. It is used to deliver your websites
and it is basically the "Web traffic language". You proably want to allow this
protocol. It is pretty secure for itself but the content you transmit is not
secured. A lot of security holes have been discovered in browsers so you may
want to secure your machines itself with a anti virus tool.
