DHCP is the "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol". It is used to automatically
supply basic network data like IP address, nameservers and routig information
to your clients. It makes no sense to have a DHCP client on a firewall so this
protocol is only supported with your firewall as a DHCP server.
